            "description": "An experimental chess engine that combines deep learning with traditional chess search techniques. Built in Rust, it uses a neural network trained on 37 million chess positions as its evaluation function, trading computational speed for pattern recognition. The project explores whether lower search depth can be compensated for by encoding positional understanding directly into the evaluation function.",
